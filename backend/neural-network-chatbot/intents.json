For the past several days, there has been no water supply, which is causing severe inconvenience to the residents. Basic daily activities such as cooking, cleaning, and sanitation have become extremely difficult due to the lack of water. This issue is affecting the health and hygiene of the community, especially for families with children and elderly members. We have tried to manage with stored water, but it is no longer sufficient. I kindly request the concerned authorities to take immediate action to resolve the problem and ensure a regular and uninterrupted water supply at the earliest. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter."
